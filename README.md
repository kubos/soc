# Google Summer of Code ideas page for KubOS

Kubos is applying to participate in [Google Summer of Code] 2019 with
our [KubOS](https://github.com/kubos/kubos) flight software. This page
lists project ideas for KubOS.

We encourage students to get in contact with us to discuss project ideas
as early as possible. This is best done by joining our [slack](https://slack.kubos.com/)
and jumping into the #soc channel. 

## Project Ideas

Concrete project ideas are on their way...for now here are some likely
categories that the ideas will fall under:

### Services

At the heart of the KubOS framework are services which provide common system
functionality or hardware abstractions which can be easily reused across missions.

Major core services with potential for interesting projects include telemetry storage,
file transfer, shell access and radio communications.

### Tooling

A big piece of the KubOS developer experience is SDK tooling designed to integrate
with KubOS systems. These tools facilitate common developer tasks such as
creating new projects, updating software on embedded targets and testing software
on embedded targets.

### IDE Integration

A big upcoming feature in the KubOS SDK is a custom IDE with tight integration
into the developer tooling and on-board system.

### Testing

Automated testing is a huge part of improving and maintaining code quality
in any project. KubOS currently has an extensive set of unit tests, but
we would love to put in more work around automating integration testing.

There could be some interesting work here with emulating complete systems
for system-level integration tests or emulating missions for long term
reliability testing.

### Trello

Another great place to look for potential project ideas is our development
[trello board](https://trello.com/b/pIWxmFua/kubos-community).
